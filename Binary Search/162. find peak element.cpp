    // Que: A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.
    // Given a 0-indexed integer array nums, find a peak element, and return its index. If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to any of the peaks.
    // You may imagine that nums[-1] = nums[n] = -âˆž. In other words, an element is always considered to be strictly greater than a neighbor that is outside the array.
    // You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.

            // Output: 5
            // Explanation: Your function can return either index number 1 
            // where the peak element is 2, 
            // or index number 5 where the peak element is 6.
            
            // Algo:
            // find peak element with the help of binary search
            // the criteria of peak element is It should be greater than its neibouring elements
            // 1. Set L = 0 and R = nums.size()-1
            // 2. So find mid = (L+R)/2
            // 3. if the element is greater than its neibouring elements then return that as peak element so return its index
            // 4. If the element is > than left neibour and It is less than right neibour then peak element may exists in right side of mid
            // 5. So set L = mid+1 in this case 
            // 6. If the element is < than left neibour and It is > right neibour then peak element exists is left side of mid
            // 7. So set R = mid-1 in this case
